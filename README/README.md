# Updated Portfolio

## Requirements


## Description

This is the password generator for the unit8 homework.
for this homework I needed to combine HTML, CSS, and JS. This project demonstrates my skills using Javascript. Javascript really brings webpages to life. It feels like half of the time I understand JS and can accomplish a lot. The other half of the time it is really hard for me to figure out why things aren't working. I felt like I was on the right path with this project and when it came down to it the characters for the password weren't generating like they were supposed to.


## Installation

In order to install this project follow the Github link to https://github.com/kacox1251/updated-portfolio and fork the project. After that clone the repository through your Git Bash. To do that type 'git clone" and paste the HTML link inside your terminal, it will ask you for your github password. After the repository is safed in the directory of your choice you can access the HTML and CSS files and view them in your default browser.
You can also download as a zip file by clicking "Download zip" in the "Clone or Download" dropdown.
You can also see the live site by following the link to https://kacox1251.github.io/updated-portfolio/.

## Usage

On this page you can see a box that says "your secure password, and two buttons that say "Generate Password" and "Copy to Clipboard". Clicking "Generate Password" will bring up a few prompts. The first prompt will ask what length you want your password to be, any number between 8 and 128 is acceptable. Next it will ask you if you want to add capital letters, lower case letters, special characters, or numbers. You have to choose at least one. After that your password will generate and it will be shown in the box that said "your secure password." If you want to copy the password to your clipboard then click the "copy to clipboard" button.
