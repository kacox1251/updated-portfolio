                <p class="lead">My name is Krystal Cox and I am taking the DU full stack bootcamp because I want a full and fulfilling career in programing. I am currently working in the additive manufacturing industry. My company develops metal alloys to be 3D printed. I am a Safety Coordinator, Senior Technician, and Inventory Manager.
                    I have a couple of hobbies that I am passionate about in my free time. I do a style of Jiu Jitsu called Danzan Ryu, and I have been doing that since I was 15 years old. I also love playing Roller Derby. I got into roller derby about 2 or 3 years ago on a whim. The game is a little rough but I am a tough enough and know how to keep myself safe and I have a lot of fun. The game has a big closenit community that feels almost like a family. I also love to travel. I have been all around the country but have only been out of the country once.
                    When I was 19 I took a trip with my old high school as a chaperone to Japan and Hong Kong. I worked very hard to be able to save enough money to pay for it and I want nothing more than to continue to travel the world.</p>
                <p class="lead">I am a part of a large family and am the oldest of 6. My father lives out in California with his wife and sons and my mom lives with my other siblings here in Colorado. I don't live with either of them since I moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years, but I make every effort to see them and be active in their lives.</p>
